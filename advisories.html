<h2>Mogwai Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h2>
<p>
This policy outlines how Mogwai handles responsible vulnerability disclosure to product vendors and the general public. Mogwai will responsibly and promptly notify the appropriate product vendor of a security flaw with their product(s) or service(s). It is the goal of this policy to balance the need of the public to be informed of security vulnerabilities with vendorsâ€™ need for time to respond effectively.
</p>
<p>
Our policy is based on the vulnerability disclosure policy from Thierry Zoller, with slightly modified time frames.

  title="Open Source Vulnerability Database" href="http://www.osvdb.org/" target="_blank">OSVDB</a>, an e-mail requesting the security contact e-mail address may initially be sent to certain public e-mail addresses associated with the vendor. Online forms may only be used to request security contact information.</li><li>When a security contact or other relevant e-mail address has been identified, a vendor initially receives a mail with vulnerability details along with a pre-set disclosure date (usually set to a Wednesday two week later).</li><li>If the vendor does not respond to the initial mail within a week, it is resent.</li><li>If no response has been received at the day of the pre-set disclosure date, the vulnerability information is published immediately without further coordination attempts.</li><li>If the vendor responds to either the initial mail or the resent mail, a new disclosure date may be set in case the vendor cannot meet the pre-set date.</li><li>We expect to receive continuous status updates from the vendor and a list of all affected products, should no list be given it is assumed all products are vulnerable. If none are provided by default, the vendor will be contacted about once a month with a status update request (if time permits).</li><li>Should a vendor not respond to a status update request, it is resent.</li><li>Should the vendor not respond to two consecutive status update requests, a mail is sent to the vendor advising that the vulnerability information will be disclosed a week later if no response is received. Has no response been received by this date, the vulnerability information is immediately published without further coordination attempts.</li><li>Eventually, the vulnerability information will be published by me when:<br
  /> a) The pre-set/agreed disclosure date is reached.<br
  /> b) The vendor issues a fix and/or security advisory<br
  /> c) Information about the same vulnerability is published by a third party.<br
  /> d) A year from the initial contact date has passed<br
  /> e) the vendor denies the security nature of the bug and/or gives no credit for my work</li><li>Unless the vendor asks for an extension, as will not coordinate a vulnerability disclosure for more than 6 months. After 6 months the details will be published regardless of patch availability.</li></ol>
