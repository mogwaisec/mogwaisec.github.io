Vendor's Description of the Software:
-------------------------------------
PowerFolder is the leading on-premise solution for file synchronization and
collaboration in your organization. PowerFolder Business Suite and PowerFolder
Enterprise Suite both offer a fully integrated and secure solution for backup, 
synchronization and collaboration.

Support for federated RADIUS, LDAP and RESTful APIâ€˜s allow PowerFolder to blend 
in perfectly into your environment while all data is stored on your
own IT infrastructure, ensuring that your data remains 100% under your control.


Business recommendation:
------------------------
Apply patches that are provided by the vendor. Restrict access to the PowerFolder
port, as the vulnerability might be exploited with other gadgets.

Vulnerability description
----------------------------
The PowerFolder server and client are written in Java. Data exchange
is mainly done via serialized objects that are send over a dedicated 
port (TCP port 1337). This service allows deserialization of untrusted
data, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.[1][2]

The tested PowerFolder version contains a modified version of the Java
library "ApacheCommons". In this version, the PowerFolder developers 
removed certain dangerous classes like org.apache.commons.collections.functors.InvokerTransformer
however, exploitation is still possible using another gadget chain [3].

Proof of concept:
